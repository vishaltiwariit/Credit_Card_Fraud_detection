# Credit_Card_Fraud_detection
## Context
### It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
## Objectives
* Perform basic data preprocessing in Python
* Model a classification task using the Scikit-Learn and Snap ML Python APIs
* Train Suppport Vector Machine and Decision Tree models using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML
* Run inference and assess the quality of the trained models
## About Dataset
* The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
* This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
